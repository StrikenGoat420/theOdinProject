This project is titled as 'Etch-A-Sketch' on theOdinProjects website. For this project we have to create a 'sketch-pad' which contains many blocks. When the user hovers over one block, the colour of the block should change. For this project not all HTML and CSS will be generated using JavaScript DOM manipulation, only the blocks themselves will be. There will be a seperate CSS file for design purposes as well, to ensure that the website looks presentable.
