Implemented a library where the user can add and delete books as they want. This project was done as part of the Odin Projects curriculum.
So far the basic functionalities (ie. Add, Remove, and Sorting) have been implemented and the desired page structure (HTML) is achieved.

TODO:	Work on the CSS to make the page look and feel much nicer
	Implement storage (both local and online) so that the user can access his/her data when visisting the site once more.
